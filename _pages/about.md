I am a Computer Science Master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), specializing in the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and high-performance systems. I am currently researching multi-stage RL (DPO, GRPO) while focusing on hardware acceleration and scalable ML infrastructure.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) where I graduated 6th out of 286 students with a GPA of 3.91/4.0. During my undergraduate studies, I spent a semester at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/) / Max Planck Institute for Informatics through the Erasmus Exchange Programme.

I'm a builder at heart with a track record of winning hackathons and a strong interest in applying optimization techniques to complex problems like time-series and quant research.

## Research Interests

- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and policy optimization (DPO, GRPO, PPO)
- Large Language Model alignment and evaluation
- Hardware acceleration for data processing
- Scalable ML infrastructure and cloud computing
