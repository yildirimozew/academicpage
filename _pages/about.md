I'm a CS Master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), working on retrieval, reinforcement learning and how to make ML systems go faster. Right now I'm training LLMs to be Socratic tutors (the kind that help students think instead of just giving away the answer) using multi-stage RL (DPO, GRPO).

Before Zurich, I did my undergrad in Computer Engineering at [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) in Ankara (3.91/4.0, 6th out of 286), and spent a semester at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/) / Max Planck Institute for Informatics through Erasmus.

Outside of research, I like building things. I've won a couple of hackathons, and I keep building stuff that I'm interested in.

## What I work on

Language Model policy optimization (DPO, GRPO, PPO), AI for Education, Retrieval Systems, LLM alignment and evaluation, scalable ML, systems for ML.
